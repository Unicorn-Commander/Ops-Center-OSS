- [ ] Monitoring dashboard designs
- [ ] Feature roadmap updated

## Timeline
- **Phase 1** (0-2 hours): Frontend deployment + immediate wins
- **Phase 2** (2-4 hours): Quality assurance + testing
- **Phase 3** (4-6 hours): Infrastructure optimization
- **Phase 4** (6-8 hours): Strategic planning + documentation
- **Phase 5** (Final hour): Consolidation + morning briefing

## Constraints
- NO breaking changes to production code
- NO infrastructure changes without testing
- NO user decisions required
- ONLY safe, tested improvements
- ALL changes must be reversible

## Success Criteria
1. Geeses feature fully deployed and functional
2. Zero regression errors introduced
3. Performance improvements measurable
4. Complete documentation for all changes
5. Morning briefing ready for user
