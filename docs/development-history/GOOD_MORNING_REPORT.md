## 🚨 Issues to Fix (When You Have Time)

### Critical (8-10 hours):

1. **Geeses Agent Card API** - `/api/v1/geeses/agent-card` returns 404
   - Needs backend endpoint implementation
   
2. **Hardcoded Credentials** - Found in reset_aaron_password.py
   - Security risk - remove immediately
   
3. **JWT Validation** - Incomplete in authentication layer
   - Complete token validation logic
   
4. **Database Indexes** - Missing on high-traffic tables
   - Add 12 strategic indexes (SQL provided)

### High Priority (2-4 hours):

5. **Console.log() Cleanup** - 485 statements in frontend
   - Replace with proper logging or remove
   
6. **Admin Endpoints** - 3 subscription endpoints return 403
   - Fix RBAC permissions
   
7. **Rate Limiting** - Not implemented
   - DoS vulnerability - add middleware

### Nice to Have:

8. **server.py Modularization** - 5,015 lines is unwieldy
9. **Frontend Code Splitting** - Reduce 2.7MB bundle
10. **N+1 Query Optimization** - User management performance
