# 🗺️ Ops-Center Roadmap

> **Vision**: Transform Ops-Center from a management dashboard into an intelligent, AI-powered infrastructure command center.

This roadmap outlines our planned features and improvements. Community feedback and contributions are welcome!

## 🎖️ Flagship Feature: The Colonel Agent

**The Colonel** is our planned AI-powered infrastructure orchestration assistant. Think of it as an AI Platform Engineer that can integrate applications, configure billing tiers, set up organizations, and manage access control—all through natural language conversation.

### Planned Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Status |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Application Integration** | "Colonel, integrate this new app into our stack with its own pricing tier" | 🔬 Research |
| **Organization Setup** | "Set up org-admin, manager, and user tiers for the new client" | 📋 Planned |
| **Billing Configuration** | "Create a $49/mo tier with 10,000 API calls and access to GPT-4" | 📋 Planned |
| **Access Control** | "Give the marketing team read-only access to analytics" | 📋 Planned |
| **Infrastructure Provisioning** | "Spin up a new instance for the enterprise client" | 💭 Concept |
| **Cost Optimization** | AI recommendations to reduce cloud/LLM spend | 📋 Planned |

### Example Conversation

```
You: Colonel, we have a new client "Acme Corp" that needs their own instance.
     They want 3 tiers: Admin, Manager, and User.

Colonel: I'll set that up. Here's my plan:
         1. Create organization "Acme Corp"
         2. Create 3 roles: acme-admin, acme-manager, acme-user
         3. Configure tier permissions:
            - Admin: Full access, billing, user management
            - Manager: Team management, usage reports
            - User: App access only
         4. Set up SSO group mappings in Keycloak

         Estimated monthly cost: $0 (included in your plan)

         Should I proceed?

You: Yes, and give them access to the Pro model list.

Colonel: Done. I've also:
         - Created invite link for their admin: https://...
         - Set up usage alerts at 80% and 100%
         - Added them to your billing dashboard
```

### Technical Approach
- Integration with Claude/GPT APIs for reasoning
- Tool-use capabilities for Ops-Center APIs
- Multi-step workflow orchestration
- Audit logging for all AI-initiated actions
- Human-in-the-loop approval for billing/access changes
